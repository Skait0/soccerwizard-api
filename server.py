# --- background refresher -------------------------------------------------
# Seven markets by seven pages is forty-nine round trips to SportyBet. That
# never belonged inside a visitor's request: done serially it outran the
# worker timeout and the worker was killed before it could fall back to stale
# data, and done concurrently the burst got this server refused outright.
# Either way the endpoint answered 500 and the cache could never refresh.
#
# So the fetch runs on its own thread and the route only ever reads what that
# thread has stored. Nobody waits for SportyBet, a slow or refused fetch costs
# a stale answer rather than an error, and the request path cannot time out
# because it does no network work at all.
